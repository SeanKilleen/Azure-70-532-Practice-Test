			<br/>
			Your website requires you to make some changes post deployment. You deploy to a non-production slot so you can first make those changes before finally swapping with the production slot.

		<section class="answer" data-correct>Within the same virtual machine (VM) instance as the Production deployment slot</section>
		<section class="answer">Within a separate physical machine as the Production deployment slot</section>
		<section class="description">
			All deployment slots for the same website are hosted within the same Virtual Machine (VM). This is especially important to remember when stress testing a non-production deployment slot prior to swapping it into production. A significant amount of load on a non-production deployment slot can affect the performance of the live, production website.
